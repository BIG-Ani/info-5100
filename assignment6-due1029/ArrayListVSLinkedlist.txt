Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList

1. Data structure
ArrayList is implemented based on array, which has index and linear storage architecture
LinkedList is implemented with class Node, which contains a data and pointers

2. Visiting time
ArrayList can support randomly visiting, because of it index attribute. This will only take O(1)
For LinkedList, what has to do is to traverse from end to match the data and target, which may take O(n)
