Encapsulation:
It is a technology which is Object-Oriented Programming. Creating a class, we set
up relative statuses and behaviors. As the impact of encapsulation, the outside can
only access the variables and methods with public visiting methods, as well as
not knowing how the detail implementation. Importantly, the style of programming 
form this influence - encapsulation.

Abstraction:
This is to say that abstraction is a set of conceptions, like behaviors related to an
object, not exactly exist. Especially, it is an imagination, or process to identify specific
class.
