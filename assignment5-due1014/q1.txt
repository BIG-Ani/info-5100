Assignment5

Explain the difference between final and finally

Answer:
final is a key word for data(include class and classes' field variables). Class with final can not be extended; variable with final can not be changed.

finally is a key word for exception processing syntax(try... catch... finally). Usually used to process free resources after catching the exceptions.
